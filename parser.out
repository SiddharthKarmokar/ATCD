Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> S
Rule 1     S -> A B
Rule 2     A -> a
Rule 3     B -> b

Terminals, with rules where they appear

a                    : 2
b                    : 3
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

A                    : 1
B                    : 1
S                    : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . S
    (1) S -> . A B
    (2) A -> . a

    a               shift and go to state 3

    S                              shift and go to state 1
    A                              shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (0) S' -> S .



state 2

    (1) S -> A . B
    (3) B -> . b

    b               shift and go to state 5

    B                              shift and go to state 4

state 3

    (2) A -> a .

    b               reduce using rule 2 (A -> a .)


state 4

    (1) S -> A B .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (S -> A B .)


state 5

    (3) B -> b .

    $end            reduce using rule 3 (B -> b .)
